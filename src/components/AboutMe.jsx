          ðŸ‘‹ Hey! I'm Andreia. I come from a fashion background, but I've decided to change my path and dive into the world of technology. I'm passionate about design and functionality, and I absolutely love front-end development. Anything challenging really gets me excited! But what truly drives and inspires me is seeing the final result of my creations.
